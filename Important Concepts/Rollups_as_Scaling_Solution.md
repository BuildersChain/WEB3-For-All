# Rollups in Blockchain as a Scaling Solution!

Rollups are a Layer 2 scaling solution in blockchain that aim to reduce the load on the main chain by aggregating multiple transactions into a single transaction, which is then submitted to the main chain for validation. This allows for more transactions to be processed per block on the main chain, improving the scalability of the blockchain.

There are two types of rollups: optimistic rollups and zk-rollups. Optimistic rollups assume that transactions are valid unless proven otherwise. They rely on a fraud proof system to ensure the correctness of the transactions. zk-rollups, on the other hand, use zero-knowledge proofs to verify the validity of transactions, eliminating the need for a fraud proof system.

In both cases, rollups can significantly increase the throughput of a blockchain without compromising its security. By aggregating transactions off-chain and submitting only the relevant data to the main chain, rollups can reduce the cost and time required to process transactions, making blockchain more accessible to users and developers alike.
