# What are Crypt-Wallets?

**Wallets work as your entry point for using cryptocurrency programmes,** sometimes referred to as **dapps**, in a manner similar to how browsers act as your entry point for using the internet.

Unlike traditional wallets, which holds your different credit and debit cards, cash & other stuffs, Digital wallets are intangible, which holds a variety of objects, such as credit card information, digital cash & etc.

Digital wallets made for Web3 include crypto wallets. They assist you in controlling who has access to your data, storing cryptocurrencies and NFTs, and more.

### At their root, all wallets—physical or digital—hold your power so you may use it wherever you are.

Your wallet serves as a place to keep and manage the digital keys that make up your identity. _To connect to a dapp, transfer or receive cryptocurrency, purchase or sell NFTs, and other actions on a blockchain, you require these keys. Consider your wallet to be a Web3 permissions manager where you may authorise access for the apps you want to utilise._

Your **"Secret Recovery Phrase" (SRP)** or **"seed phrase"** is a special phrase that is generated as soon as your cryptocurrency wallet is setup. Yes, this phrase may appear obscure, but in reality it is merely a master cryptographic password that you must keep private. Your digital public addresses and private keys—one pair for each account you create in MetaMask—sprout from this seed.

The initial method of self-identification on the blockchain is the public address. It functions similarly to your bank account number, however your private key (which is obtained from your SRP) more closely resembles your bank account pin code, which you would want to keep private and secure.

Both of these keys are managed by your cryptocurrency wallet, which enables simple transactions on the Ethereum network. A hardware wallet offers an extra degree of security by keeping your keys offline to take security to the next level.
