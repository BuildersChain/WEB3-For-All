## Cryptocurrency?

Crypto, which is short for **cryptocurrency**, is a type of digital currency that relies on cryptography for security. In 2008, **Bitcoin became the first** **cryptocurrency** that could be used to transfer funds globally without the involvement of a **middleman**.

In **traditional financial transactions**, a middleman is a central authority, such as a bank or government, that intervenes between the sender and receiver. Middlemen have the power to monitor, control or reverse transactions, and can share sensitive data with third parties. They also determine which financial services are available to users.

However, with crypto, transactions take place directly between sender and receiver, without the need for a central authority. This means that no one else can access your funds, and there are no restrictions on the financial services you can use. All of this is made possible by the underlying blockchain technology on which cryptocurrencies are based.
