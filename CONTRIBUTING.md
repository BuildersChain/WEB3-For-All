# How To Contribute?

Guidelines for contributing to this repo!

- Find an issue which you want to resolve. You can find issues from the issues tab associated with the repos!

> - Fork the repository associated with the issue to your local GitHub organization. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under `your-GitHub-username/repository-name`. Then clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git`.
> - Create a new branch for your fix using `git checkout -b branch-name-here`. Make the changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
> - Use `git add insert-paths-of-changed-files-here` to add the file contents of the changed files to the "snapshot" git uses to manage the state of the project, also known as the index.
> - Use `git commit -m "Insert a short message of the changes made here"` to store the contents of the index with a descriptive message.
> - Push the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin branch-name-here`.

- Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.

- Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so **"Added More Content! #3453"**.

- Explain the changes you made, any problems you believe the pull request has, and any queries you have for the maintainer in the description of the pull request. No pull request is flawless, so it's okay if yours isn't too; the reviewer will be able to assist you in fixing any issues and making improvements.

- Wait for the pull request to be reviewed by a maintainer. Make changes to the pull request if the reviewing maintainer recommends them.

- Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!ðŸ’œâœŒðŸ˜ŽðŸš€
